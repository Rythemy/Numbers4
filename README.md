# Numbers4
A small program to emulate the lottery Numbers 4

Have the user choose from 2 options: enter four 1-digit numbers, or have the program randomly generate them. Then the program will generate their own set of four numbers. 
If the numbers the user chose or generated match the program's numbers, the player wins.
